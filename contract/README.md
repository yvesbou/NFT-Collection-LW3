# Contracts

### Deployed Contracts

| Contract                | Network | Contract address                                                                                                                  |

### Project built with Foundry

Start your own Foundry Project with:

```shell
mkdir contract
cd contract
forge init
```

### Deploy contract

```shell
# To give our shell access to our environment variables
source .env
# To deploy and verify our contract
forge script script/CryptoDevs.s.sol:CryptoDevsScript --rpc-url $GOERLI_RPC_URL  --private-key $GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY -vvvv

```

## Troubleshooting

### Third Party Libraries in Foundry Project

Install dependencies Foundry natively via Github

```shell
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts

```

Use it in solidity script

```Solidity
import "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
```

Note:
When having a folder structure like this:

```
- NFT-Collection-LW3
    - .git
    - contract (foundry project)
    - frontend
```

Meaning, you deleted the `.git` file in your foundry project, which was automatically setup, and you work from a .git file in the main project repo, because you wanted to have frontend and contract in the same git repository, `forge install` will setup `.gitmodules` in the NFT-Collection-LW3 folder outside of the contract folder. Make sure to copy it over to the existing `.gitmodules` file inside the contract folder.

If you get warnings like `... not found: File import callback not supported` make sure to open the project with VS Code not at the root (NFT-Collection-LW3) but on the contract level. Furthermore, follow the next chapter as well to prevent warnings from solidity.

### VS Code Warnings

Changing to different libraries with Solidity projects can be pretty challenging. By the time writing this, I recommend to work with the [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) by Juan Blanco. But to make it work properly with Foundry settings must be set correctly. You could change global settings of VS Code inside, but if you end up working with hardhat and foundry, depending on the teams you work with, I recommend to add a settings file to your project.

```
- contract
    - .vscode
        - settings.json
```

Inside this file make sure to have at least this (ofc you can add your flavor to it regarding the aliases of the import or the solc compiler).

```
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "solidity.formatter": "prettier",
    "solidity.defaultCompiler": "remote",
    "solidity.compileUsingRemoteVersion" : "latest",
    "git.ignoreLimitWarning": true,
    "solidity.remappings": [
        "@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/",
        "ds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/",
        "forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/"
      ],
}
```

Solution for settings found [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2019).

### Dependencies not found when deploying contracts

Even though we specified solidity remappings for vs code, we get an error like this.

```shell
Compiler run failed
error[6275]: ParserError: Source "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol" not found: File not found.
```

We need to add additionally a `remappings.txt` file at the root of the foundry project.

```.txt
ds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/
forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/
@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
```
