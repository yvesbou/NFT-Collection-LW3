## Level 9 - Sophomore Track - LearnWeb3DAO
In the Sophomore Track of LearnWeb3DAO are different tasks you need to solve. However, they are heavily guided. I decided to take just the task and build the thing myself. Because I then discover problems to which I need to find solutions myself. But I like the curriculum of the LearnWeb3DAO. It emphasises the most important building blocks of a Web3 Developer.

A summary what I've learned.
- Frontend
    - Working with Styled Components.
    - Create animated UI
- Smart Contract Tooling
    - Write Tests in Solidity with Foundry (Forge)
        - Including Fork Testing, since I depended on Smart Contracts already deployed.
    - Handle local blockchain with Foundry (Anvil)
    - Documented lots of questions and answers
        - [Foundry Dependencies not resolved for deployment of Contract](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/135652/foundry-dependencies-not-resolved-for-deployment-of-contract)
        - [How to assert failing require statement in Foundry](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/136158/how-to-assert-failing-require-statement-in-foundry)
        - [How to fund an address in foundry test](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/136164/how-to-fund-an-address-in-foundry-test)
        - [Withdraw fails in Foundry Test](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/136285/withdraw-fails-in-foundry-test)
